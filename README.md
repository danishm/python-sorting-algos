# python-sorting-algos
Basic sorting algorithms implemented in Python. Although Python already includes
the excellent Timsort algorithm implementation, this was done more as an
academic exercise to not forget the basic principles of sorting.

This is basically a companion to my blog post

This should make it easy for people to contribute and recommend changes while
helping beginners to see how to run them.
